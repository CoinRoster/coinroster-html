            What does CoinRoster do with users' BitCoins?
        </span>
        <div class="input_padding description_text">
            A very small percentage of our users' BitCoins are kept in "live" wallets hosted at CoinBase. 
            This allows us to handle day-to-day deposits and withdrawals in a timely manner. 
            The rest of the BitCoins are kept in offline "cold storage" wallets.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Our #1 security measure at CoinRoster is that there is no software link between the website and the actual bitcoins. 
            We maintain a mirrored set of books offline. If someone were to hack CoinRoster,
            they could make an absolute mess of our site for a few days - but our users' bitcoins would be safe.

            How much personal info do I need to provide?
        </span>
        <div class="input_padding description_text">
            None. All we need is a username, password, and your public wallet address. 
            We recommend adding an email so that you receive records of your account activity. 
            Also, without a verified email address you will not be able to recover your account if you lose your password.

            What are RosterCoins (RC)?
        </span>
        <div class="input_padding description_text">
            RosterCoins are an internal currency that we use to award bonuses to players.
            1 RC is worth 1 BTC, but RC can only be used to enter contests. For example, if you have 0.5 BTC and 0.5 RC and a contest entry requires 1 BTC, you can enter the contest.
