                    To make withdrawals from your CoinRoster account, we need to have a wallet address on file for you.
                    You can only have one address connected at a time, but you can change your address in certain circumstances.

                <div class="input_padding">
                    By default, you can change your connected wallet address whenever you want. We tend to give users as much control as
                    possible over their accounts.

                <br/>

                    Enabling security
                </span>
                <div class="input_padding">
                    After connecting a wallet you will have the option to enable wallet security, which will prevent you from changing your wallet
                    address if you have Bitcoin in your account.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This is to prevent a would-be hacker from compromising your account and withdrawing your Bitcoins to a foreign wallet.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If you do enable security, you will need to withdraw all Bitcoins out of your account in order to change your wallet address.
