            Connected Wallet Security
        </div>
        <div class="input_padding description_text">
            To make deposits and withdrawals to/from your CoinRoster account, we need to have a public wallet address on file for you.
            You can only have one address connected at a time, but you can change your address in certain circumstances.
        </div>
        <br/>
        <span class="orange">
            Default security setting
        </span>
        <div class="input_padding description_text">
            By default, you can change your connected wallet address <i>if and only if</i> your Bitcoin balance is 0.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If we were to let you change your wallet address while your account had Bitcoins in it, a hacker could:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            - steal your password
            <br/>
            - log in
            <br/>
            - change your wallet address
            <br/>
            - request a withdrawal
        </div>
        <br/>
        <span class="orange">
            Disabling security
        </span>
        <div class="input_padding description_text">
            After connecting a wallet you will have the option to disable this security measure, which will enable you to change
            your connected wallet address at any time. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You can disable security <i>if and only if</i> your Bitcoin balance is 0. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If we were to let you disable security while your account had Bitcoins in it, a hacker would now have one extra step:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            - steal your password
            <br/>
            - log in
            <br/>
            - disable security
            <br/>
            - change your wallet address
            <br/>
            - request a withdrawal
        </div>
        <br/>
        <span class="orange">
            Re-enabling security
        </span>
        <div class="input_padding description_text">
            If you <i>do</i> decide to disable security, you can re-enable it at any time. If you have Bitcoins in your account when you re-enable security, you will NOT be able to disable it again until you have 
            withdrawn all of your Bitcoins to your connected wallet.
